A musical implementation of John Conway's *Game of Life* in MATLAB.<br>

[What is the game of life?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk)

<br>
If you have MATLAB, you can install Game-of-MIDI as an app using

**Rules:** 
<br>
If a cell is in a live state it will remain alive if there are 2 or 3 alive cells orthogonal to it.<br>
If a cell is in a dead state it will become alive if there are 3 alive cells orthogonal to it.

**Happy MIDI'ing!**
