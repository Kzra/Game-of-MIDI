# Game-of-MIDI
A musical implementation of John Conway's *Game of Life* in MATLAB.<br>
Game of MIDI generates and plays MIDI notes based on the game of life simulation.<br>

**Rules:** 
<br>
If a cell is in a live state it will remain alive if there are 2 or 3 alive cells orthogonal to it.<br>
If a cell is in a dead state it will become alive if there are 3 alive cells orthogonal to it.

**Happy MIDI'ing!**
